\section*{ABSTRACT}
\justify 
This project describes a multi-robot system designed to use Bluetooth wireless communication to solve the “Honeybee” task. The Honeybee task is a simple search and navigation problem that requires a “guide” robot to lead another “blind” robot to a specific target within the environment. Topics discussed include advantages and disadvantages of using Bluetooth in robotics, as well as a variety of behaviors required to solve the Honeybee task.\\
This project aims to implement and display the concept of swarm intelligence. Swarm intelligence is closely tied up with the Honeybee Problem described above. When two or generally more than two robots of similar or varying complexity work together in harmony to complete a single task or objective, where each robot does not necessarily perform the same task, swarm intelligence is said to be implemented. Various constraints such as budget and availability of resources prevented us from implementing swarm concept using more than two bots. Hence, only two bots of varying complexities are used in this project.
