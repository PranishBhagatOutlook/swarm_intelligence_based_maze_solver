\subsection{Scope of Work}
Our final year project entitled “Swarm Intelligence Based Maze Solver” aims to develop and simulate the swarm concept in robotics by assigning specific tasks to each of the robots. The project is designed to develop a system of inter-communicating robots using the concept of swarm robotics. The primary objective of the first robot will be to solve a given maze and detect a target, namely smoke, within the maze whose location is unknown. Initially,  a single robot shall traverse the entire maze and shall detect the target. The map produced by the first robot shall be decoded and the effective shortest path will be transmitted to the  another robot via Bluetooth.Finally, the second robot traverses the shortest possible path   upto the target.\\
From this project, the idea of swarm robotics can be explained and verified. Using robust maze solving algorithms and precise communication technique methods the various objectives of our project will be fulfilled. Developing a robot which autonomously navigates its way through a maze and successfully detects a target is one of the many objectives of our project. Along with that, establishing a sound and secure communication link between two robots is another equally important objective of our project.
